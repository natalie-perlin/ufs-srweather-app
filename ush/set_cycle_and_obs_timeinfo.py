    This function reads in a subset of the parameters in the verification
    configuration dictionary and ensures that certain temporal constraints on
    these parameters are satisfied.  It then returns an updated version of
    the verification configuration dictionary that satisfies these constraints.

    The constraints are on the accumulation intervals associated with the
    cumulative field groups (and the corresponding observation types) that
    are to be verified.  The constraints on each such accumulation interval
    are as follows:

    1) The accumulation interval is less than or equal to the forecast length.
       This ensures that the forecast(s) can accumulate the field(s) in the
       field group over that interval.

    2) The obs availability interval evenly divides the accumulation interval.
       This ensures that the obs can be added together to obtain accumulated
       values of the obs field, e.g. the 6-hourly NOHRSC obs can be added to
       obtain 24-hour observed snowfall accumulations.  Note that this also
       ensures that the accumulation interval is greater than or equal to the
       obs availability interval.

    3) The forecast output interval evenly divides the accumulation interval.
       This ensures that the forecast output can be added together to obtain
       accumulated values of the fields in the field group.  For example, if
       the forecast output interval is 3 hours, the resulting 3-hourly APCP
       outputs from the forecast can be added to obtain 6-hourly forecast APCP.
       Note that this also ensures that the accumulation interval is greater
       than or equal to the forecast output interval.

    4) The hour-of-day at which the accumulated forecast values will be
       available are a subset of the ones at which the accumulated obs
       values are available.  This ensures that the accumulated fields
       from the obs and forecast are valid at the same times and thus can
       be compared in the verification.

    If for a given field-accumulation combination any of these constraints
    is violated, that accumulation is removed from the list of accumulations
    to verify for that field.

    Args:
        vx_config (dict):

        fcst_len (datetime.timedelta):
            The length of each forecast; a timedelta object.

    represent all the days on which observations are needed.  This allows
    the ROCOTO workflow to define a single set of non-consecutive days on
